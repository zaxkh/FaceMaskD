This is the my initial post for my blog.

Initial ideas

- Prototype a tracking system used in a shopping mall in relation with contact tracing. Bluetooth LE tags are used to track extremely accurately. This will allow for more definitive results on how much it has spread, and specifically which people will be affected. 

- Prototype a smart camera using the Kinect. By the use of tensor-flow data models, we will be able to identify when an action associated with crime is committed.

- Prototype a cheap camera for windows desktops used for facial recognition login as well as gesture control.

- Prototype a digital ID for our university using NFC in order for it fully functional with opening doors, using existing secure methods (Apple Pay, Android Pay).

- Prototype an accurate recipe prediction based on specific criteria collected by the user swiping on ingredients and dished presented in a similar manner to tinder.
